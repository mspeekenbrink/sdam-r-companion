# Reproducible reports with RMarkdown

One of the _many_ things that makes R extremely useful as a data analysis platform is its ability to generate high-quality reproducible reports and documents via R Markdown. Markdown itself is a lightweight markup language, with a plain-text formatting syntax. Markdown documents can be "parsed" to produce documents in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, Open Document Type, Microsoft Word, you name it... R Markdown integrates Markdown with R, allowing you to use R to include figures, tables, and R output (as well as the corresponding code, if you wish) directly in the document. A big benefit of this is that can keep your analysis and write-up in one place, so you don't have to copy-paste results from one place to another (which often results in errors and issues). Including all analysis in the same document allows for completely __reproducible research__. Anyone with the R Markdown file would be able to reproduce everything in a scientific paper.

R Markdown is extremely flexible and useful. For instance, this book was completely written in R Markdown, with help from the additional `bookfown` package (https://bookdown.org/).

This chapter provides a brief introduction to R Markdown, as well as the `papaja` package to produce output in the APA style. As an introduction, there are many things left unsaid, so you will quite likely have to consult other sources to get properly acquainted with all the possibilities of R Markdown. A good reference to R Markdown is the [R Markdown cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/). Another source showcasing the many possibilities of R Markdown is [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). This chapter includes parts of the latter book. To get started with R Markdown, you can create a template from within RStudio, by clicking on the menu `File > New File > R Markdown`. You can fill in the title of your document, your name, and choose the output format (HTML, PDF, or Word). A new R Markdown document will be generated. If you click on the `knit` button, just above the file, you will be prompted to save the file, and then the file will be parsed and the output document generated.

## YAML headers

Headers in R Markdown files contain some metadata about your document, which you can customize to your liking. They use a syntax called [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). Below is a simple example that purely states the title, author name(s), date, and output format.

```{markdown}
---
title: "My title"
author: "Mr My full Name"
date: "December 21, 2020"
output: html_document
---
```

You can change the output option to `pdf_document`, or `word_document`. Some other arguments you may want to provide in the YAML header are for the bibliography and the style of the output. For example, the previous header can be expanded to

```{markdown}
---
title: "My title"
author: "Mr My full Name"
date: "December 21, 2020"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    number_sections: true
    theme: cerulian
bibliography: references.bib
biblio-style: apalike
---
```

This would produce an HTML output with a floating table of contents (`toc: true`, `toc_float: true`), numbered sections, and the "cerulian" theme (see e.g. https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/ for some of the available themes). In addition, it tells the R Markdown compiler to look for BibTex references in the `references.bib` file, and use an APA style for references. There are many things that can be specified in the header file. To make this process easier, you can install the `ymlthis` package, which also provides an RStudio plugin with a graphical user interface for some common options (see  https://ymlthis.r-lib.org/). 

Note that if you want to create PDF documents you additionally need a [TeX](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) distribution. If you have no use for TeX beyond rendering R Markdown documents, I recommend you use [TinyTex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/). TinyTex can be installed from within R as follows.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if(!"tinytex" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Other, more full-fledged LaTeX [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) for Mac, or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Linux.

## Markdown syntax

The text in an R Markdown document is written with the Markdown syntax. Precisely speaking, it is Pandoc's Markdown. There are many flavours of Markdown invented by different people, and Pandoc's flavour is the most comprehensive one to our knowledge. You can find the full documentation of Pandoc's Markdown at https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html. We strongly recommend that you read this page at least once to know all the possibilities with Pandoc's Markdown, even if you will not use all of them.

### Inline formatting

Inline text will be _italic_ if surrounded by underscores or asterisks, e.g., `_text_` or `*text*`. **Bold** text is produced using a pair of double asterisks (`**text**`). A pair of tildes (`~`) turn text to a subscript (e.g., `H~3~PO~4~` renders H~3~PO~4~). A pair of carets (`^`) produce a superscript (e.g., `Cu^2+^` renders Cu^2+^).

To mark text as `inline code`, use a pair of backticks, e.g., `` `code` ``. To include $n$ literal backticks, use at least $n+1$ backticks outside, e.g., you can use four backticks to preserve three backtick inside: ````` ```` ```code``` ```` `````, which is rendered as ```` ```code``` ````.

Hyperlinks are created using the syntax `[text](link)`, e.g., `[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)`. The syntax for images is similar: just add an exclamation mark, e.g., `![alt text or image title](path/to/image)`. Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`, e.g., `^[This is a footnote.]`.

There are multiple ways to insert citations, and we recommend that you use BibTeX databases, because they work better when the output format is LaTeX/PDF. [Section 2.8](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html) of @xie2016bookdown explains the details. The key idea is that when you have a BibTeX database (a plain-text file with the conventional filename extension `.bib`) that contains entries like:

```bibtex
@Manual{R-base,
  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical
    Computing},
  author = {{R Core Team}},
  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
  address = {Vienna, Austria},
  year = {2017},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```

You may add a field named `bibliography` to the YAML metadata, and set its value to the path of the BibTeX file. Then in Markdown, you may use `@R-base` (which generates "@R-base") or `[@R-base]` (which generates "[@R-base]") to reference the BibTeX entry. Pandoc will automatically generated a list of references in the end of the document.

### Block-level elements

Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs, e.g.,

```markdown
# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header
```

If you do not want a certain heading to be numbered, you can add `{-}` or `{.unnumbered}` after the heading, e.g.,

```markdown
# Preface {-}
```

Unordered list items start with `*`, `-`, or `+`, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list, e.g.,

```markdown
- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item
```

The output is:

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item

Ordered list items start with numbers (you can also nest lists within lists), e.g.,

```markdown
1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item
```

The output does not look too much different with the Markdown source:

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item

Blockquotes are written after `>`, e.g.,

```markdown
> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain
```
The actual output (we customized the style for blockquotes in this book):

> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
>
> --- Mark Twain

Plain code blocks can be written after three or more backticks, and you can also indent the blocks by four spaces, e.g.,
````markdown
```
This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
```
Or indent by four spaces:
    This text is displayed verbatim / preformatted
````
In general, you'd better leave at least one empty line between adjacent but different elements, e.g., a header and a paragraph. This is to avoid ambiguity to the Markdown renderer. For example, does "`#`" indicate a header below?

```markdown
In R, the character
# indicates a comment.
```

And does "`-`" mean a bullet point below?

```markdown
The result of 5
- 3 is 2.
```

Different flavours of Markdown may produce different results if there are no blank lines.

### Math expressions

You can write mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax. [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a system for scientific typesetting widely used in academia. It has excellent support for mathematical notation. Below, you will find some examples. For more extensive information on mathematical notation, you can consult e.g. https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics

Inline LaTeX equations\index{LaTeX math} can be written in a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, e.g., `$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$` (actual output: $f(k)={n \choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$); math expressions of the display style can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, e.g., `$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$`, and the output looks like this:

$$f\left(k\right)=\binom{n}{k}p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}$$

You can also use math environments inside `$ $` or `$$ $$`, e.g.,

```latex
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23}
\end{array}$$
```

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23}
\end{array}$$

```latex
$$X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{1}\\
1 & x_{2}\\
1 & x_{3}
\end{bmatrix}$$
```

$$X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{1}\\
1 & x_{2}\\
1 & x_{3}
\end{bmatrix}$$

```latex
$$\Theta = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta\\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}$$
```

$$\Theta = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta\\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}$$

```latex
$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$
```

$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$

## R code chunks and inline R code {#r-code}

In R Studio, you can insert an R code chunk\index{code chunk} either using the RStudio toolbar (the `Insert` button) or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + I` (`Cmd + Option + I` on macOS).

There are a lot of things you can do in a code chunk: you can produce text output, tables, or graphics. You have fine control over all these output via __chunk options__, which can be provided inside the curly braces (between ```` ```{r```` and `}`). For example, you can choose hide text output via the chunk option `results = 'hide'`, or set the figure height to 4 inches via `fig.height = 4`. Chunk options are separated by commas, e.g.,

````markdown
`r ''````{r, chunk-label, results='hide', fig.height=4}
````

The value of a chunk option can be an arbitrary R expression, which makes chunk options extremely flexible. For example, the chunk option `eval` controls whether to evaluate (execute) a code chunk, and you may conditionally evaluate a chunk via a variable defined previously, e.g.,

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
# execute code if the date is later than a specified day
do_it = Sys.Date() > '2018-02-14'
```

`r ''````{r, eval=do_it}
x = rnorm(100)
```
````

There are a large number of chunk options\index{chunk options} in **knitr** documented at https://yihui.name/knitr/options. We list a subset of them below:

- `eval`: Whether to evaluate a code chunk.

- `echo`: Whether to echo the source code in the output document (someone may not prefer reading your smart source code but only results).

- `results`: When set to `'hide'`, text output will be hidden; when set to `'asis'`, text output is written "as-is", e.g., you can write out raw Markdown text from R code (like `cat('**Markdown** is cool.\n')`). By default, text output will be wrapped in verbatim elements (typically plain code blocks).

- `collapse`: Whether to merge text output and source code into a single code block in the output. This is mostly cosmetic: `collapse = TRUE` makes the output more compact, since the R source code and its text output are displayed in a single output block. The default `collapse = FALSE` means R expressions and their text output are separated into different blocks.

- `warning`, `message`, and `error`: Whether to show warnings, messages, and errors in the output document. Note that if you set `error = FALSE`, `rmarkdown::render()` will halt on error in a code chunk, and the error will be displayed in the R console. Similarly, when `warning = FALSE` or `message = FALSE`, these messages will be shown in the R console.

- `include`: Whether to include anything from a code chunk in the output document. When `include = FALSE`, this whole code chunk is excluded in the output, but note that it will still be evaluated if `eval = TRUE`. When you are trying to set `echo = FALSE`, `results = 'hide'`, `warning = FALSE`, and `message = FALSE`, chances are you simply mean a single option `include = FALSE` instead of suppressing different types of text output individually.

- `cache`: Whether to enable caching. If caching is enabled, the same code chunk will not be evaluated the next time the document is compiled (if the code chunk was not modified), which can save you time. However, I want to honestly remind you of the two hard problems in computer science (via Phil Karlton): naming things, and cache invalidation. Caching can be handy but also tricky sometimes.

- `fig.width` and `fig.height`: The (graphical device) size of R plots in inches. R plots in code chunks are first recorded via a graphical device in **knitr**, and then written out to files. You can also specify the two options together in a single chunk option `fig.dim`, e.g., `fig.dim = c(6, 4)` means `fig.width = 6` and `fig.height = 4`.

- `out.width` and `out.height`: The output size of R plots in the output document. These options may scale images. You can use percentages, e.g., `out.width = '80%'` means 80% of the page width.

- `fig.align`: The alignment of plots. It can be `'left'`, `'center'`, or `'right'`.

- `dev`: The graphical device to record R plots. Typically it is `'pdf'` for LaTeX output, and `'png'` for HTML output, but you can certainly use other devices, such as `'svg'` or `'jpeg'`.

- `fig.cap`: The figure caption.

- `child`: You can include a child document in the main document. This option takes a path to an external file.

Chunk options in **knitr** can be surprisingly powerful. You are encouraged to read the `knitr` documentation to discover the possibilities. You may also read @xie2018r, which is freely available online at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/.

There is an optional chunk option that does not take any value, which is the chunk label. It should be the first option in the chunk header. Chunk labels are mainly used in filenames of plots and cache. If the label of a chunk is missing, a default one of the form `unnamed-chunk-i` will be generated, where `i` is incremental. I strongly recommend that you only use alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z` and `0-9`) and dashes (`-`) in labels, because they are not special characters and will surely work for all output formats. Other characters, spaces and underscores in particular, may cause trouble in certain packages, such as **bookdown**.

If a certain option needs to be frequently set to a value in multiple code chunks, you can consider setting it globally in the first code chunk of your document, e.g.,

````markdown
`r ''````{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 8, collapse = TRUE)
```
````

Besides code chunks, you can also insert values of R objects inline in text.\index{inline R expression} For example:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x = 5  # radius of a circle
```

For a circle with the radius `r '\x60r x\x60'`,
its area is `r '\x60r pi * x^2\x60'`.
````

### Figures

By default, figures\index{figures} produced by R code will be placed immediately after the code chunk they were generated from. For example:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
plot(cars, pch = 18)
```
````

You can provide a figure caption using `fig.cap` in the chunk options. If the document output format supports the option `fig_caption: true` (e.g., the output format `rmarkdown::html_document`), the R plots will be placed into figure environments. In the case of PDF output, such figures will be automatically numbered. If you also want to number figures in other formats (such as HTML), please see the **bookdown** package in https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/books.html.

PDF documents are generated through the LaTeX files generated from R Markdown. A highly surprising fact to LaTeX beginners is that figures float by default: even if you generate a plot in a code chunk on the first page, the whole figure environment may float to the next page. This is just how LaTeX works by default. It has a tendency to float figures to the top or bottom of pages. Although it can be annoying and distracting, we recommend that you refrain from playing the "Whac-A-Mole" game in the beginning of your writing, i.e., desparately trying to position figures "correctly" while they seem to be always dodging you. You may wish to fine-tune the positions once the content is complete using the `fig.pos` chunk option (e.g., `fig.pos = 'h')`. See https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Positioning_images_and_tables for possible values of `fig.pos` and more general tips about this behavior in LaTeX. In short, this can be a difficult problem for PDF output.

To place multiple figures side-by-side from the same code chunk, you can use the `fig.show='hold'` option along with the `out.width` option. Figure \@ref(fig:hold-position) shows an example with two plots, each with a width of `50%`.

```{r hold-position, fig.cap='Two plots side-by-side.', fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
plot(pressure, pch = 17)
```

If you want to include a graphic that is not generated from R code, you may use the `knitr::include_graphics()` function, which gives you more control over the attributes of the image than the Markdown syntax of `![alt text or image title](path/to/image)` (e.g., you can specify the image width via `out.width`).

````markdown
`r ''````{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='...'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/cute-cat-picture.png')
```
````


### Tables

The easiest way to include tables\index{tables} is by using `knitr::kable()`, which can create tables for HTML, PDF and Word outputs.^[You may also consider the **pander** package. There are several other packages for producing tables, including **xtable**, **Hmisc**, and **stargazer**, but these are generally less compatible with multiple output formats.] Table captions can be included by passing `caption` to the function, e.g.,

````markdown
`r ''````{r tables-mtcars}
knitr::kable(iris[1:5, ], caption = 'A caption')
```
````

Tables in non-LaTeX output formats will always be placed after the code block. For LaTeX/PDF output formats, tables have the same issue as figures: they may float. If you want to avoid this behavior, you will need to use the LaTeX package [longtable](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/longtable), which can break tables across multiple pages. This can be achieved by adding `\usepackage{longtable}` to your LaTeX preamble, and passing `longtable = TRUE` to `kable()`.

If you are looking for more advanced control of the styling of tables, you are recommended to use the [**kableExtra**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=kableExtra) package, which provides functions to customize the appearance of PDF and HTML tables. Formatting tables can be a very complicated task, especially when certain cells span more than one column or row. It is even more complicated when you have to consider different output formats. For example, it is difficult to make a complex table work for both PDF and HTML output. We know it is disappointing, but sometimes you may have to consider alternative ways of presenting data, such as using graphics.

## APA documents with `papaja`

To help you write documents according to the APA guidelines, you can use the [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) package. This section contains materials adapted from [the papaja readme](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/README.Rmd).

### Installation

To use `papaja` you need either an up-to-date version of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) or [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).


`papaja` is not yet available on CRAN but you can install it from this repository:

```{r install_papapja, eval = FALSE}
# Install devtools package if necessary
if(!"devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("devtools")
# Install the stable development verions from GitHub
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")
# Install the latest development snapshot from GitHub
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja@devel")
```


### How to use papaja

Once `papaja` is installed, you can select the APA template when creating a new Markdown file through the RStudio menus.

![APA template selection](inst/images/template_selection.png)

If you want to add citations specify your BibTeX-file in the YAML front matter of the document (`bibliography: my.bib`) and you can start citing. If necessary, have a look at R Markdown's [overview of the citation syntax](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). You may also be interested in [citr](https://github.com/crsh/citr), an R Studio addin to swiftly insert Markdown citations.

#### Helper functions to report analyses

The functions `apa_print()` and `apa_table()` facilitate reporting results of your analyses. Take a look at the [R Markdown-file](https://github.com/crsh/papaja/blob/master/inst/example/example.Rmd) of the example manuscript in the folder `example` and the resulting [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crsh/papaja/master/inst/example/example.pdf).

Drop a supported analysis result, such as an `htest`- or `lm`-object, into `apa_print()` and receive a list of possible character strings that you can use to report the results of your analysis.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("papaja")
```

```{r}
my_lm <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width + Petal.Length, data = iris)
apa_lm <- apa_print(my_lm)
```

One element of this list is `apa_lm$table` that, in the case of an `lm`-object, will contain a complete regression table. Pass `apa_lm$table` to `apa_table()` to turn it into a proper table in your PDF or Word document.

```{r}
apa_table(apa_lm$table, caption = "Iris regression table.")
```

`papaja` currently provides methods for the following object classes:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print_classes <- gsub("apa_print\\.", "", as.character(utils::methods("apa_print")))
print_classes <- print_classes[!grepl(",", print_classes)]
print_classes <- c(print_classes, rep(NA,  (4 - length(print_classes) %% 4) * (length(print_classes) %% 4 > 0)))
print_classes <- matrix(print_classes, ncol = 4)
colnames(print_classes) <- apply(print_classes, 2, function(x) {
  first_letters <- tolower(substr(x, 1, 1))
  first_letters <- c(first_letters[1], tail(first_letters, 1))
  first_letters[is.na(first_letters)] <- "z"
  col_names <- if(first_letters[1] == first_letters[2]) first_letters[1] else paste(first_letters, collapse = "-")
  toupper(col_names)
})
print_classes[is.na(print_classes)] <- ""
print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)] <- paste0(print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)], "<sup>*</sup>")
knitr::kable(print_classes)
```

\* Not fully tested, don't trust blindly!


#### Plot functions

Be sure to also check out `apa_barplot()`, `apa_lineplot()`, and `apa_beeplot()` (or the general function `apa_factorial_plot()`) if you work with factorial designs:

```{r}
apa_factorial_plot(
  data = npk
  , id = "block"
  , dv = "yield"
  , factors = c("N", "P", "K")
  , ylim = c(0, 80)
  , level = .34
  , las = 1
  , ylab = "Yield"
  , plot = c("swarms", "lines", "error_bars", "points")
)
```

If you prefer creating your plots with `ggplot2` try `theme_apa()`.
